# Clueless-Life

"What do we do now?" 
This is the question that every human being is constantly asking, from the day of his birth until the day he dies. 

This game proposes to experience various key moments in the life of a human being. For each of these moments, 
the player is facing a problem but he doesn't exactly know to solve it.

This game, developed during the 2015 Global Game Jam, proposes to impersonate a young father, whose baby is crying in the middle of the night. He will have to discover why, and help his baby to calm down and return to a peaceful sleep. 

It is important to notice that there are a several reasons why the baby may be crying (e.g. he might be hungry, or need his dummy, etc.). Each time the game is ran, a combination of these objectives is chosen, to create a unique experience each time you play.
